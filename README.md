# Grid Layout Practice

This repository contains my practice exercises with CSS Grid Layout. I've named each section using grid areas and arranged them using grid column areas for a structured and responsive design.
  ##Responsive Design
  I've made the layout responsive using media queries, adapting to smaller and medium-sized devices.
## Sections

1. **Header:** Positioned at the top of the grid layout, this section serves as the header for the webpage.

2. **Main Content:** The main content area is structured into different grid areas for better organization and layout control.

3. **Sidebar:** On the left or right side of the layout, the sidebar is created with a dedicated grid area.

4. **Footer:** Positioned at the bottom of the grid layout, the footer contains essential information or navigation links.

## Grid Areas

I've used meaningful names for each grid area to improve code readability and maintenance. Here are the grid areas used in this project:

```css
grid-template-areas:
  "header"
  "nav"
  "main"
  "sidebar"
   "advertisement"
  "footer";
